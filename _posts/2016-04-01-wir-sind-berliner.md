Wir sind Berliner!

More and more creative people from all over the world are finding inspiration in Berlin's experimental climate and are choosing to move their professional and personal lives here. My wife Camilla and I are delighted to be amongst them. The city offers plenty of artistic freedom, extraordinary spaces, a relatively low cost of living and rents, global networks and, not least, a public interested in design that is open to new ideas. Design has thus become one of the most important factors behind the city's economic success.
