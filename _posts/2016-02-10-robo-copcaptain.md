# Robo Cop/Captain

Whilst attenting the Marine and Tidal Learning Journey with HIE at MIT we were lucky enough to be intoduced to Ford Professor Harry Asada and his team.

Originally designed to look for cracks in nuclear reactors' water tanks, the innovative oval robot could also inspect ships for the false hulls and propeller shafts that smugglers frequently use to hide contraband. Because of its small size and unique propulsion mechanism --- which leaves no visible wake --- the robots could, in theory, be concealed in clumps of algae or other camouflage. Fleets of them could swarm over ships at port without alerting smugglers and giving them the chance to jettison their cargo.

"It's very expensive for port security to use traditional robots for every small boat coming into the port," says Sampriti Bhattacharyya, a graduate student in mechanical engineering, who designed the robot together with her advisor, Ford Professor of Engineering Harry Asada.
